/*
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data 
(that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) 
are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia

Task
Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) 
of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the 
original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings.
Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

Examples
As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. 
It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

runLengthEncoding("hello world!")
 //=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]
It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:

runLengthEncoding("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb")
 // => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]
*/

const runLengthEncoding = (str) => {
	const res = { 1: {} }
	let part = 1
	for (let ind in str) {
		let char = str[ind]
		let prev = str[ind - 1]
		if (char !== prev) {
			part++
			res[part] = {}
		}
		res[part][char] ? res[part][char]++ : (res[part][char] = 1)
	}
	return Object.values(res)
		.map((obj) => Object.entries(obj))
		.flat()
		.map((e) => e.reverse())
}

module.exports = { runLengthEncoding }
